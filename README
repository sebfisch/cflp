# Constraint Functional-Logic Programming in Haskell

The `cflp` package provides a module `Control.CFLP` with combinators
for constraint functional-logic programming ((C)FLP) in Haskell. The
combinators might later be used as a target language for compiling
programs written in an FLP language like Curry or Toy. Another
application of FLP is demand driven test-case generation.

Consult the LICENSE file for copyright issues, the INSTALL file for
installation instructions, or the [project website][cflp] for
background information on this package.
